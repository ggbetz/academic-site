Gregor Betz is professor of philosophy of science at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Since the release of GPT-2 in 2019, he has been pursuing computational philosophy projects at the intersection of NLP and AI involving so-called large language models. (See [highlights](#highlights) below.)

Before turning to GenAI, Gregor has been studying the limits of scientific prediction, esp. in economics and climate science, the role of values in science, requirements of democratic scientific policy advice, and the ethics of climate engineering. He has developed a formal theory and computational models of argumentative debate, and applied these methods to clarify key concepts in epistemology, to interpret classical texts, to assess consensus- and truth-conduciveness of debate, as well as to to improve critical thinking teaching.

Moreover, in 2023, Gregor has founded [Logikon AI](https://logikon.ai), a startup that applies critical thinking methods to improve generative AI.
